# SAGA - Search And Get Answers  
(HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js, REST)

This project was completed within a 24-hour window during the Hackathon Hack2Impact, which was sponsored by Huawei and organized by DeviTeam.

Hackathon Problem: Develop a tool that would improve the university campus life. 

SAGA (Search And Get Answered) is an online search engine that provides a centralized hub for accessing a wide range of information related to Al Akhawayyn university (AUI), including academic and administrative resources, and campus events and activities. SAGA's search functionality is powered by advanced algorithms that analyze and rank the relevance of the information retrieved based on user queries.

Overall, SAGA streamlines the information search process, saving users time and effort while ensuring they have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information available.

# SAGA includes three sections:
| Section | Purpose |
|---------------------|----------|
| **Home** | This is the home page of the website, which contains our search engine. When the user enters a query in the search bar, the search function retrieves the most relevant pages from the MongoDB database and displays them in order of relevance to the user's query. |
| **Admin** | While regular users are only allowed to fetch data in the home page, the admin page provides an interface for modifying, deleting or adding new data (new cards). It is only accessible by authorized users, such as website administrators, and faculty members. |
| **About** | The about page contains information about SAGA's mission and objectives. |
